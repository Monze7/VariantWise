Toyota Fortuner Legender expert review

Expert Quote
------------
“The Legender, apart from its cosmetic updates, isn’t all that different from the standard Fortuner. So the reasons to buy one still remain the same. The only thing to consider is the price premium over the already rather costly Fortuner.”

Exterior
--------
The Fortuner always looked big and dominating, but the Legender adds some style and suave to all that muscle. All the gloss black elements give the only existing white exterior colour a good contrasting look. The quad LED headlights, sequential turn indicators, and 18-inch alloys give the rugged SUV a premium touch.

Interior
--------
The Fortuner Legender’s interior feels rugged with a strong and reassuringly solid build quality. While the design might be simple, I liked the dual tone black and maroon theme, which feels premium and sporty. I found the front seats to be large and supportive, ensuring comfort during long drives. Despite the side steps, getting in and out will require some effort, especially for elderly people. The second row has ample space for all kinds of passengers, but three people won’t be very comfortable on long journeys. I appreciate the slide and recline function which helps improve space and comfort. With one touch tumble for the second row, entering the third row is easy, but staying there for longer journeys isn’t recommended for adults and it’s best used by children. The storage spaces are adequate with dual gloveboxes, sunglass holder, multiple door bottle pockets and storage beneath the central armrest. Features Here’s a quick look at all the feature highlights of the Fortuner Legender: Highlight Features Remarks 8-inch Touchscreen The user interface feels outdated and the resolution isn’t as crisp as you’d expect. Does get Android Auto and Apple Carplay MID display Small screen between the analogue dials. Functional, but feels too rudimentary Front Seat Ventilation Functions as intended. 6-speaker sound system Sub par audio quality. Standard Fortuner’s 11-speaker JBL system is missed. Connected car technology Easy to use remote functions and also gets smart watch compatibility

Safety
------
The Toyota Fortuner Legender hasn’t been crash tested yet. As for features, it packs seven airbags, ABS with EBD, traction control, hill-hold control and ISOFIX child seat mounts.

Boot Space
----------
With all the three rows up, the Legender’s boot space is good enough only for a few laptop bags. The boot space can be expanded significantly by folding down the third row. Even the second row gets a 60:40 split if you want to carry really large items or furniture.

Performance
-----------
2.8-litre Diesel In typical old school fashion, the diesel rumbles to life, and you can hear more of the noise inside as you build speed. With plenty of torque, I found it really easy to drive the Legender in any situation – be it picking up speeds from really low RPMs in city traffic or just making that quick overtake on a highway. The automatic is smooth, and only feels a little slow when you ask for a quick overtake. I just use the paddle shifters to get it down a gear timely. If driven with a light foot, you can get an efficiency of 9-11kmpl in the city and around 13-15kmpl on the highway.

Ride and Handling
-----------------
The Legender’s ability to go over bad or non-existent roads effortlessly never ceases to amaze me. There’s only some side to side movement over the rough stuff, which is acceptable for a ladder-frame SUV. With its rock solid stability over a sudden bump or undulations, it gave me confidence at higher speeds. Option of a 4x4 drivetrain is perfect for people who like adventure, or wish to often drive in sandy/snowy terrains. It handles like a big SUV, but still remains stable around a fast corner.

Variants
--------
Which variant of Toyota Fortuner Legender is value for money? The Toyota Fortuner Legender is available in a single variant. However, you can choose from either a 4x2 or 4x4 drivetrain.

Verdict
-------
Is the Toyota Fortuner Legender right for you? The Legender builds on the Fortuner’s robust reputation and brings a unique look to the package. It doesn’t have the hi-tech features or the comfort of a few of its rivals, but its sense of reliability and ability to go on tirelessly are hugely appealing. If you don’t mind paying the hefty premium over the standard Fortuner for visual differences, then you can consider the Legender.
