Hyundai Creta expert review

Expert Quote
------------
“As a family SUV, the Creta doesn’t ask you to compromise on any relevant front. It’s on par with the segment in terms of look, features, and powertrains, but the experience feels good enough to be the benchmark with its attention to detail and all round package”

Overview
--------
The Hyundai Creta has been a top-selling compact SUV in India time and again, and for good reason. It’s one of the few models that offer a complete package, catering to the needs of different individuals with its well-sorted variants and multiple powertrain options, while keeping the core things such as space, comfort and features right. But with the segment evolving with the introduction of hybrids like the Maruti Grand Vitara and new bodystyles like SUV-coupes, does the Hyundai Creta still stand out?

Hyundai Creta Exterior
----------------------
I like the overall styling, which is a blend of modern and rugged elements with squared-out styling cues and chunky cladding. It features full-LED headlamps in the top model, whereas base models get a halogen projector headlamp. The new connected lighting signature is offered at the front and rear. In higher models, the Creta also gets dynamic turn indicators. Lower variants get 16-inch wheels, whereas higher models get 17-inch alloy wheels. Colour options on the Hyundai Creta 2025 include: Abyss Black, Robust Emerald Pearl, Fiery Red, Ranger Khaki, Atlas White, Titan Grey, Titan Grey Matte And Starry Night. Only the white colour is offered with a dual-tone option, where it gets a black roof. In the ‘Knight’ edition, Hyundai offers a black finish on the grille, alloy wheels and emblems. An interesting touch is the red front brake calliper. For those wanting a sportier design, Hyundai also offers the Creta in an ‘N Line’ version with different bumpers, larger 18-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler.

Creta Interior
--------------
Design and Quality Hyundai has completely redesigned the dashboard. It now features a twin screen setup, and a lot of horizontal elements that add to the sense of width. There’s improvement in fit and finish and quality of materials used too. Hyundai has opted for a soft texture on the top half of the dashboard which feels premium. The grey dual-tone cabin theme makes the cabin look larger. There are copper coloured accents which give the cabin an upmarket look. If you prefer a sportier interior, you can consider the Knight Edition model that gets an all-black cabin theme with brass coloured accents. For the climate control panel and the floor console, Hyundai has used piano black plastic which is prone to scratches and dust Driving Position Seat-height adjustment and tilt-telescopic adjustment for the steering is offered as standard on the 2025 Creta, making it easy to get a comfortable driving position. Some might feel that the driving position is too high, even with the seat set to its lowest position. A central armrest is provided, which makes long journeys comfortable. Passenger Comfort The cushioning of the Creta’s seats is balanced, offering good comfort on both short and long journeys The front seats offer good support and have enough room even for taller driver Rear seat space is one of the highlights of the Creta. Average-sized adults won’t have any complaints with the second row. Knee room is plenty, while head and underthigh support are adequate. Despite the front seat being in its lowest position, there’s even decent space to stretch your feet ahead. Only above-average adults with a height of 6ft or above will find the headroom to be restricted. I really appreciate the adjustable recline, central armrest, sun shades and neck pillows that further add to the comfort factor of the Creta’s rear seats. Three average sized adults will be able to sit comfortably in the rear seat thanks to the flat cushioning. A central headrest is sadly missing. Storage options The Creta’s cabin is super practical in terms of storage spaces. All four doors get 1-litre bottle pockets, and there are two cup holders in the central console for the front passengers. The dashboard gets an open space that can be used to store a phone or keys, while the wireless charging pad can also be used as a space to tuck away a wallet if required. The glovebox is spacious and cooled as well, which can be used to keep soft drinks cold on longer drives. There’s also a small storage space beneath the central armrest. Rear passengers get seatback pockets and a small phone tray underneath the rear AC vents. Features Here’s a quick look at the highlight features of the 2025 Hyundai Creta: Dual-zone climate control allows you to set different temperatures for the driver and co-driver side. Rear AC vents are provided as standard, enhancing comfort. The 10.25-inch touchscreen has an easy-to-understand interface, great resolution and fast response times. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are offered, but it’s wired via a type-A USB cable. Notably, the lower variants of the Creta with the smaller 8-inch touchscreen get wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. 8-speaker BOSE branded audio system offers decent clarity and bass. Audio enthusiasts might feel the need for an upgrade. The driver gets a high-resolution 10.25-inch display. Themes on this display can be linked to the drive modes. It also displays the feed from the side cameras when you indicate, very helpful. 8-way powered adjustment for the driver’s seat functions as intended. However, a memory function is sorely missed. Front seat ventilation gets three levels which can be toggled using the buttons in the centre console. A panoramic sunroof is available from the EX (O) variant onwards. From the SX variant onwards, the sunroof can also be opened/closed using voice commands. An electronic parking brake with auto hold functionality is available in the automatic variants. Auto-hold will hold the brake for you in bumper-to-bumper traffic/at traffic signals, making city commutes easier. Other features on the Creta 2025 include keyless entry, push-button start/stop, cruise control, automatic headlamps, type-C USB chargers and a wireless charger.

Creta Safety
------------
Standard safety features of the 2025 Creta include: 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill assist, and a tyre pressure monitoring system. You can pick any variant and still have maximum safety features. Higher variants of the Creta also get a 360° camera which makes parking very convenient. Another highlight in the safety package is Level 2 ADAS with features such as auto emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alerts. We found the system to be well-tuned for Indian conditions. This facelifted version of the Hyundai Creta hasn’t been crash tested by any NCAP agency yet.

Hyundai Creta Boot Space
------------------------
Creta’s 433-litre boot space seems large on paper. However, the space on offer is wide and shallow. It is best to use small cabin-sized trolley bags to maximise the space available. One large suitcase will take up almost the entirety of the boot. There's a 60:40 split in the rear seats, which can be folded away to store bigger luggage.

Hyundai Creta Performance
-------------------------
The Creta is one of the few in its segment to offer a choice between three 1.5-litre engine options, each paired with different transmissions. The options include a naturally aspirated petrol, a turbo-petrol and a diesel unit. The automatic versions get drive modes: Eco, Normal and Sport as well as traction modes: Snow, Mud and Sand. Engine 1.5-litre petrol 1.5-litre diesel 1.5-litre turbo-petrol Output 115PS/144Nm 116PS/250Nm 160PS/253Nm Gearbox Manual CVT Manual AT DCT Fuel efficiency (claimed) 17.4kmpl 17.7kmpl 21.8kmpl 19.1kmpl 18.4kmpl *CVT = continuously variable transmission, DCT = dual clutch automatic transmission, AT = torque convertor automatic transmission 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol This petrol engine of the Creta is smooth and refined, best suited for city driving. Acceleration isn’t strong, but it’s ample for relaxed driving. In the automatic (CVT) model, the drive experience is smooth with no jerks. It offers a very calming experience. It cruises effortlessly at speeds of 100-120kmph. But, overtakes will need planning at higher speeds, especially if you’re travelling with family and/or luggage. You can expect a fuel efficiency of 10-12kmpl in the city and 14-16kmpl on the highway. 1.5-litre turbo-petrol The turbo-petrol engine offers an exciting drive. Should be considered by those wanting to drive themselves, mostly on the highway. It drives smoothly in heavy traffic and overtakes in the city are easy. The dual clutch automatic transmission (DCT) feels smooth when driving in a relaxed manner, and quick and snappy when needed. Hitting triple digit speeds is easy and even overtaking at those higher speeds doesn’t take much effort. It’s not very efficient in the city: 10kmpl is a best case scenario if used in heavy traffic. Highway efficiency is better, and you can expect a mileage between 13-15kmpl. 1.5-litre diesel This four-cylinder engine is amongst the smoothest in the market. Refinement levels are above average. The diesel offers an effortless drive in the city, while the performance is adequate for highway usage. With plenty of low-end torque, you don’t need to downshift frequently with the manual. The automatic version offers smooth shifts, even if it is slightly slow to respond, especially compared to the DCT. You can expect 13kmpl and 18kmpl in the city and highway, respectively. The diesel-automatic combination would be my pick out of all options, since it offers the best balance of performance and fuel economy.

Hyundai Creta Ride and Handling
-------------------------------
The Creta’s suspension absorbs most of the city’s rough roads and potholes, while maintaining stability and comfort over undulations or expansion joints on the highway. You will feel some minor movement over sharper speedbreakers or deeper potholes. A constant up/down movement can also be felt inside if the road surface isn’t smooth, which can cause slight discomfort on longer highway trips. It also poses strong braking performance with a 100-0kmph stopping distance of 38.12 metres.

Hyundai Creta Variants
----------------------
Which variant of Hyundai Creta is value for money? Hyundai Creta 2025 is available in a total of nine variants: E, EX, EX (O), S, S (O), SX, SX Tech, SX Premium and SX (O). A 'Knight' edition is available in the S (O) and SX (O) models. Hyundai Creta E Variant: This variant is available with both engine options, but only with a manual transmission. Even in the Creta’s base variant, safety isn’t compromised. 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, electronic stability control, tyre pressure monitoring system are available. The focus is on functionality, with features such as driver’s seat height adjust, manual air-conditioning, and rear AC vents. Hyundai Creta EX Variant: Automatic is not available in this variant of the Creta 2025 either. The biggest addition is that of an 8-inch touchscreen system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and a 6-speaker music system. Hyundai Creta EX (O) Variant: This is the base variant if you want an automatic transmission. The petrol is available with a CVT and the diesel gets a torque convertor automatic. To better justify the price difference, a panoramic sunroof is also offered. Hyundai Creta S Variant: The S variant gets features focused on improving the looks of the Creta. Updates include full-LED headlamps, LED tail lamps and 16-inch styled steel wheels. Notable feature additions are: cruise control, chilled glovebox and a rear washer wiper. Hyundai Creta S (O) Variant: This variant gets all the equipment from the Creta S, but gets two additional features: dual-zone automatic climate control and a panoramic sunroof. It also offers an optional automatic transmission with the diesel and petrol engines. Hyundai Creta S (O) Knight Edition: This is the entry point for the Hyundai Creta Knight Edition. While there are no feature add-ons over the Creta S (O), it gets blacked out elements inside and out for a sportier look. You can have it with both manual and automatic transmissions with the 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines. If you opt for the automatic variants, it additionally comes with an electronic parking brake with auto hold as well as drive and traction modes. Hyundai Creta SX Variant: This variant is offered only with the 1.5-litre petrol CVT powertrain option. Additional features over Creta S (O) includes 17-inch dual-tone alloy wheels, dynamic turn indicators, semi-leatherette upholstery and a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Hyundai Creta SX Tech Variant: This is the entry-point if you want your Hyundai Creta to be equipped with ADAS features such as lane keeping assist and forward collision avoidance as well as the Bose 8-speaker sound system. Rest of the features suite is the same as the Hyundai Creta SX. While you get both 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines, the latter is offered only with a manual here. Hyundai Creta SX Premium Variant: This variant gets some important feature additions over SX Tech such as leatherette upholstery, 8-way powered driver’s seat and ventilated front seats. However, it doesn’t get ADAS that the SX Tech variant offers. The powertrain options are exactly the same as the Hyundai Creta SX Tech. Hyundai Creta SX (O) Variant: The top variant of the Hyundai Creta SX (O) is also the only one to offer the turbo-petrol DCT powertrain. Surprisingly, this is the only variant of the Creta to offer a rear parcel tray, which we feel should be offered in lower variants. It gets all the features offered, including a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display, rain sensing wipers and a rear wireless charger. This variant offers all the powertrain options that are offered with the Hyundai Creta. Hyundai Creta SX (O) Knight Edition: This variant gets all the bells and whistles offered with the Creta SX (O) and packs blacked out design elements inside out for a menacing look. The turbo-petrol engine isn’t offered with this variant, unlike the standard SX (O). CarDekho Recommends: Consider the EX variant of the Creta if your budget is tight. This variant offers a comprehensive safety package, along with basic features such as an 8-inch touchscreen, digital driver’s display, and powered mirrors. Overall, the S(O) variant of the Creta feels the most value for money as it covers all needs and some wants too. Highlight features here include 17-inch alloy wheels, panoramic sunroof, dual-zone climate control, and cruise control.

Hyundai Creta Verdict
---------------------
If I was in the market for a comfortable, spacious and feature-loaded SUV for my family, the Creta would definitely be on my shortlist. It’s more feature-loaded and safer than ever before, while still delivering on its comfort and ease of drivability aspect. There’s no real compromise on any front and its all-round package makes it a benchmark in the segment.
