Honda Elevate expert review

Expert Quote
------------
“The Honda Elevate justifies its asking price. When viewed from the lens of a family car — something that prioritizes comfort, space, quality, and safety over all else — the Elevate is really hard to fault.”

Exterior
--------
I like how the Honda Elevate’s design stands tall and strong, despite the simple approach to the styling. It looks rugged and muscular with its chunky side cladding, roof rails, and big bumpers. The 17-inch alloy wheels look elegant, but the 16-inch steel wheel covers look dull and boring on the lower variants. While the chrome inserts look classic, I really like the all-black treatment of the Signature Black edition.

Interior
--------
The exterior’s simplicity is carried inside with a tan-black color combination, which looks classy. The dashboard is layered in different materials with plastics on top and soft touch leatherette on the lower trim. Fit and finish is acceptable. I really like the ‘click’ sound of the AC toggles. All buttons, AC vents and even the indicator stalk have a reassuring ‘built-to-last’ feel to them. The front seats are wide and accommodating, and a commanding driving position is easy to find. However, the comfort could’ve been improved for taller passengers with more underthigh support and room to stretch their feet. Practicality is ample with sizable door bottle pockets, cup holders and seat back pockets. I like the twin slots in the central console that can hold your phone and keys in place. Rear seat space is generous with ample room in all parameters. It can even accommodate three adults, but only for short journeys. Rear sun shades and seat back recline function would have made the second row even better. Features Here’s a look at the Elevate’s top features: 10.25-inch Touchscreen Great resolution. Fast response. Gets wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but user interface feels dull and old school 7-inch digital driver’s display Crisp display relays readouts like the range, tachometer g-meter and the ADAS settings. Single-pane sunroof Adds more light in the cabin. It should have had a panoramic sunroof, though. 8-speaker sound system Acceptable audio quality for regular usage. Lane Watch Camera Only available on the left side. Execution could’ve been better as the feed takes up the entire display when active. Rear-view camera Acceptable resolution. ADAS (autonomous driving assistance system) Works as intended only on well-marked expressways. The camera-based system does not function well at night or during heavy rain/fog.

Safety
------
The Honda Elevate is yet to be crash tested by any NCAP testing agency. 6 airbags, hill start assist, and electronic stability control are standard, while top variants get rear wiper and washer, auto headlights and Level-2 ADAS features.

Performance
-----------
1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine I like the smooth and refined nature of the Honda Elevate’s engine. Acceleration isn’t strong, but it’s smooth and linear – perfect for all city commutes. The CVT automatic transmission is smooth, and is enjoyed best when driven in a relaxed manner. Quick overtakes with the CVT will require planning, as the engine takes some time to build actual speed. The engine cruises comfortably at higher speeds, but overtakes are slow beyond the 80kmph mark, especially with load.

Ride and Handling
-----------------
I found the Honda Elevate to be really comfortable over regular speedbreakers, potholes or even over highway undulations. Sharper bumps are also well isolated, but you do feel the impact when going over rumble strips or multiple uneven potholes. Steering is light and easy in the city, and feels confident at higher speeds. Considering its impressive ride comfort, the Elevate’s composure and dynamism surprised me around a fast corner.

Variants
--------
Which variant of Honda Elevate is value for money? The one-above-base V variant of the Honda Elevate can be considered if you’re on a tight budget and want an automatic. The top variant of the Honda Elevate offers good overall value.

Verdict
-------
Is the Honda Elevate right for you? The Honda Elevate might not allure you with its futuristic design or modern hi-tech features, but there’s an undeniable charm in its simplicity. It delivers on all aspects of a family SUV like space, comfort, practicality and safety. So if all those qualities, along with a smooth drive is what you’re after, then the Honda Elevate is worth a test drive.
