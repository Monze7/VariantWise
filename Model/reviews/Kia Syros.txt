Kia Syros expert review

Expert Quote
------------
“It's pushing the envelope in terms of design, quality, features and most importantly, space. Priced correctly, the Syros is a small-SUV you’d find super hard to ignore.”

Exterior
--------
Syros’s design is unconventional and controversial, which can easily split opinions. This design has taken heavy inspiration from the Kia EV9, which follows the carmaker’s new design language. It has a tall boy design which is very rare these days and it sets it apart from other models in the segment. Design features vertically-planed LED headlamps and tail lamps, flat profiles, and flush-fitting door handles. These headlamps and tail lamps are placed very low and on the edge, which increases the risk of them being scratched or damaged. Kia has not added fog lamps which might cause inconvenience when driving in low visibility. It gets 17-inch dual-tone alloy wheels with a modern design, which are also similar to the ones offered with the EV9. Mid-spec variants feature 16-inch alloy wheels and the base-spec version comes with 15-inch steel wheels. The side profile makes it look like a big car, even though it is under 4 metres. The flush-fitting door handles completely the sleek and flat look, but they have to be operated manually. Its rear end is the most basic with L-shaped lighting elements, and this profile makes the Syros look more chunky and rugged. Kia offers it in 8 monotone shades: Frost Blue, Glacier White Pearl, Sparkling Silver, Gravity Grey, Intense Red, Imperial Blue, Pewter Oliver, and Aurora Black Pearl. There are no dual-tone options. The colours which suit this design best are Frost Blue, Pewter Olive, and Aurora Black Pearl. 2025 Kia Syros accessory package includes hood and doors decals, rear emblem, ORVM cover, and grille bezels.

Interior
--------
Design & Quality Unlike its exterior, Syros’ interior is appealing for most people due to its modern and rugged design. Top-spec variant dual-tone cabin with black and light grey shades, and Kia has used subtle orange inserts all around the cabin for contrast. The dashboard theme and the seat upholstery differs from variant to variant. Options include black and grey dual tone, cloud blue and grey dual tone, and all grey dual tone shades. What grabs the most attention is the 30-inch screen setup, and the new steering wheel with the off-set Kia logo. The dashboard has horizontal lines, to amplify the width of the cabin, and the doors have vertical design elements, which compliment the height of this SUV. No plastics are rough or scratchy. Kia has used smooth, textures, and glossy plastics on the dashboard which feel nice to touch. You also get soft touch padding on the armrest, doors, and steering wheel. Even the buttons on the steering wheel and in the centre console are sturdy with a satisfying clicky sound. The fit and finish is excellent and so is the material quality, which makes this cabin one of the best in the segment. As for seats, Kia offers dual-tone leatherette seat upholstery the top-spec variants, while the mid and base-spec variants get semi-leatherette seats. Driving Position Kia has offered a 4-way powered driver seat and the steering wheel has tilt adjustment. But the driver seat height adjustment is manual, and there is no telescopic adjustment in the steering wheel. This makes finding your driving position a little time consuming. The seats are well cushioned and provide good side support. The space here is good enough for tall as well as wide people. You sit high with a commanding position. The large windshield and windows also provide good visibility. Passenger Comfort Syros’ rear seats are its highlight and offer ample space for passengers. These seats not only recline but also have a sliding function, which creates additional space if required. A 6’5” tall person can easily sit behind a 6’ tall driver when the rear seats are in their rearmost position. There is no lack of headroom, even with a panoramic sunroof, and the legroom, kneeroom, and underthigh support is more than sufficient. You can also seat three people here, but the middle passenger will sit a little upright, and will struggle for shoulder room. The middle passenger also misses out on a headrest. Rear windows come with built-in sunblinds, which is a helpful addition, since the big windows let in a lot of sunlight. Storage Options All four doors get both 1-litre and 500-ml bottle holders, and the front doors get dedicated umbrella pockets too. You get two retractable cupholders in the front, along with a decent sized glovebox, cooled centre armrest storage, and a sunglass holder. The passenger side dashboard has also been scooped out which allows you to keep your phone there with ease. Rear passengers get seat back pockets, a dedicated phone pocket behind the front passenger seat, cupholders in the centre armrest, and a tray below the rear AC vents. Features The Kia Syros has pushed segment boundaries with its features list as it goes beyond the usual equipment that you get at this price point. The 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen has great resolution and crisp graphics. The new user interface is really easy to use and the screen works without any lags or delays. The 12.3-inch digital driver’s display also has great resolution, and the customisable layouts and different themes relay information in a clear manner. The 5-inch AC touchscreen is placed between the infotainment and driver’s display. It offers an alternative control for the AC settings. But functionality is limited as it is tough to use on the move. While the 8-speaker Harman/Kardon Sound System offers premium audio quality, it is a little heavy on bass. The rear seats come with a ventilation function for the outboard passengers. This feature is only at the base, not on the seatback. Still, it is a thoughtful addition. Other key features include wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, connected car technology, auto IRVM, auto ORVM, auto headlights, push button start/stop and 4-way powered driver’s seat. Multi-colour ambient lighting is well executed and looks really cool at night. The panoramic sunroof is really huge and adds to the Syros’ sense of space inside the cabin.

Safety
------
Apart from the usual 6 airbags and electronic aids like ABS with EBD, and electronic stability control, the Syros also gets tyre pressure monitoring, hill start assist and both front and rear parking sensors as standard. There’s no crash test rating yet, but Kia is confident of a good result. Level - 2 ADAS pack gets features like adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and auto emergency braking. Have been tuned for our conditions and function as intended on well marked highways.

Boot Space
----------
Sliding rear seats mean that the 2025 Syros’ boot space figure can be adjusted between 390-465 litres, depending on the position of the rear seats. The boot is deep and wide and can store your family’s weekend trip luggage with ease. There's a 60:40 split function in the rear seats too, so you can fold them in case you need to carry larger items.

Performance
-----------
Engine The Kia Syros is offered with two engine options: a 1-litre, three-cylinder turbo petrol engine and a 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder diesel engine. Both engines are available with manual and automatic transmission options. Engine 1-litre turbo petrol 1.5-litre diesel engine Power 120PS 116PS Torque 172Nm 250Nm Transmission 6-speed MT, 7-speed DCT 6-speed MT, 6-speed AT Fuel efficiency (Claimed) 18.20 kmpl (MT), 17.68 kmpl (DCT) 20.75 kmpl (MT), 17.65 kmpl (AT) *DCT = Dual clutch automatic transmission *AT = Torque convertor automatic 1-litre turbo-petrol The cabin is well insulated from the engine noise. However, you do feel some vibrations while idling. Performance isn’t exciting or punchy, but is enough for city and highway use. City driving is effortless, and I found the drive to be really smooth in heavy traffic or bumper to bumper situations. The dual clutch automatic transmission downshifts quickly when you ask for a quick overtake. When driving normally, it operates without any jerk. The paddle shifters can be used for manual control over the gear shifts and are really fun to use as well. It cruises at triple digit speeds comfortably and doesn’t take much time to reach those speeds. You can expect a fuel efficiency of 10kmpl in relaxed city driving conditions and around 14kmpl on the highway. 1.5-litre diesel engine This four-cylinder engine is among the most refined in the market. Noise and vibrations are well controlled, especially for a diesel engine. It offers a great mix of performance and efficiency. Recommended engine if you have a high running and don’t want to compromise on fuel efficiency. Plenty of torque means you can drive in second or third gear for all your city drives. You will not need to shift very often and it makes overtakes effortless as well. While highway performance isn’t punchy or exciting, it still is adequate for regular commutes and can easily maintain speeds of 100-120kmph. No complaints from the six speed AT (torque converter automatic) either, both in terms of smoothness and quickness. Paddle shifters are available in the top-spec trim for manual control. You can expect a fuel efficiency of around 13kmpl in the city and upto 18kmpl on the highway.

Ride and Handling
-----------------
There’s scope for improvement in the ride quality of the Kia Syros. It feels well cushioned over regular speed breakers or small bumps in the city, but you do move side-to-side over bigger potholes. Multiple uneven irregularities or bumps don’t let the car settle, which causes significant movement and can throw the occupants around, especially at the rear. 190mm of ground clearance gives you confidence to go over the really big and pointy speedbreakers or over really bad roads in general. While highway stability is good, rear occupants will complain about vertical movement at higher speeds, especially if the surface isn’t smooth. Because of its tall height, there’s some expected body roll around a fast corner. But you’ll feel confident in making high speed lane changes. The Kia Syros will be enjoyed more when driven in a calm and relaxed manner.

Variants
--------
The 2025 Kia Syros is available in six broad variants: HTK, HTK (O), HTK+, HTX, HTX+, HTX+ (O). Kia Syros HTK variant Gets halogen headlights, 15-inch steel wheels with covers, shark fin antenna and flush door handles. Great entertainment package with a 12.3-inch infotainment, 4-speaker sound system and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Creature comforts include rear AC vents, manual IRVM, and electronically adjustable outside mirrors. Kia Syros HTK (O) variant Features cosmetic improvements with roof rails and 16-inch alloy wheels (diesel only). Improved cabin experience with electric sunroof, LED map lighting, passenger vanity mirror and seatback pockets (passenger only). Other additions include driver seat height adjustment, 6 speaker sound system, auto outside mirrors. Kia Syros HTK + variant Improved rear seat experience with slide and recline function, rear central armrest, rear parcel shelf, and adjustable headrests. Turbo-DCT powertrain gets exclusives like front armrest, retractable cup holders, push button start/stop, drive/traction modes, and rear disk brakes. More premium cabin feel with dual tone theme, semi leatherette seats, and panoramic sunroof. Kia Syros HTX variant Looks are enhanced with a full LED lighting setup. Better cabin experience with leatherette material on all major touchpoints and more storage spaces. Key feature additions include ventilated seats, rear wiper and washer, all windows on touch up/down, and boot lamp. Kia Syros HTX + variant The 17-inch alloy wheels are offered from this variant. Save for autonomous driving assistance features (ADAS), this variant features everything that Kia offers with the Syros. Notable additions include dual HD 12.3-inch digital displays, a 5-inch touchscreen for AC control, rear ventilated seats, 4-way powered driver seat, connected car technology, dashcam, puddle lamps and wireless phone charger. Kia Syros HTX (O) + variant Adds equipment in the safety kit only. Features segment-first Level-2 ADAS features like autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane keep assist. Also features side parking sensors, and a 360-degree camera. CarDekho Recommends: If you’re tied with budget constraints, the base HTK variant is a good option as it covers all the basic needs along with a few creature comforts. Overall, the HTK Plus variant of the Kia Syros feels the most value for money with its balance of functional and comfort features. The price of the higher HTX / HTX+ variants overlaps with SUVs such as Creta/Seltos — which might seem like more car for the money.
