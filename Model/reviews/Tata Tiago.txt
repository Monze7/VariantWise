Tata Tiago expert review

Expert Quote
------------
“Tata’s Tiago has always been an impressive compact hatchback, right from its looks to its features list. The introduction of a CNG option with an AMT only makes it more versatile and compelling in the segment.”

Overview
--------
Tata’s given the Tiago a model year update, and with it the much awaited CNG option. We find out how affordable it is as compared to petrol and what are its limitations Back in January 2020, Tata launched the facelifted Tiago. Fast forward two years and the compact hatchback has just got a model year update. With this, the Tiago has received multiple cosmetic changes and probably the biggest update in the form of a factory-fitted CNG kit. Although Tata’s late to offer a CNG in this segment, there are a few strong reasons for which you may consider it. And because this review will be focused on the CNG side of the Tiago, let’s start there.

Exterior
--------
The Tiago’s design still looks fresh and modern. That’s saying something considering it’s almost a decade old now. For the Tiago 2025, Tata Motors has made minor changes to the looks of the car. It now features LED headlamps, replacing the old projector lamp setup. It has a slight smoked finish, which looks premium. There’s a new design for the grille and airdam, which brings it in sync with other Tata cars such as the Curvv and the Harrier. The fog lamp cluster and the LED daytime running lamp next to it remain untouched with the update. On the side, Tata continues to offer stylish 15-inch alloy wheels. The design is unchanged, and the dual-tone finish is carried over from the previous model as well. The rear end remains unchanged, retaining design details such as the spoiler spats and the interesting pattern for the rear defogger. Colour options for the Tiago 2025 include: Arizona Blue, Daytona Grey, Supernova Copper, Tornado Blue, Ocean Blue and Pristine White. Dual-tone options are available with Ocean Blue and Pristine White. Tata Tiago NRG 2025 models have received a minor facelift with similar changes. Colour options here include: Daytona Grey, Supernova Copper, Polar White and Grassland Beige.

Interior
--------
Design and Quality In the 2025 Tiago, the interior layout remains the same as it always was. There are two updates which immediately grab attention: the new twin-spoke steering wheel with illuminated logo, and the new free-floating touchscreen. Plastic quality is acceptable for the price. Tata Motors has used hard plastics, but the textures make it seem more expensive than it actually is. Fit and finish issues are mostly ironed out. But you might find an odd rough edge or a tiny panel gap. The black-grey dual-tone theme is neither sporty nor premium. It sits somewhere in the middle. The ‘NRG’ variant gets an all-black cabin theme which captures its outdoor vibe. Tata continues to offer fabric upholstery on the seats. It’s finished in dark grey for the regular versions, and all-black for the NRG. Driving Position Tilt-adjustment for the steering is offered as standard, and height-adjustable driver’s seat is available from the one above base model. Both enable one to get a comfortable driving position. The seats are well-cushioned and offer good support. You can spend long hours in these seats without feeling tired. Overall visibility is great, and will give new driver’s confidence. Passenger Comfort While the driver's seat can be adjusted for height, the co-driver’s seat might feel a little high set. This might cause an issue with headroom for taller occupants. In the front, I missed having a central armrest. It would have made long drives that much more comfortable. Rear seat space is acceptable by small car standards. Anyone up to 5’10” will have kneeroom to spare, and have no issues with footroom or headroom either. There’s not enough width in the cabin for three occupants to sit comfortably at the rear. It will require some compromises. Lack of adjustable headrests at the rear hampers comfort and safety, especially over longer drives. A rear armrest is also sorely missed. Storage Options The Tiago gets two cup holders near the handbrake, a space to store your phone/wallet under the climate control buttons and a cubby hole on the driver’s side of the dashboard. It also has map pockets and bottle holders on all four doors. However, the map pockets are slim and aren’t suitable for anything other than paper and cloth. The Tiago 2025 also gets a chilled glovebox, which can be used to keep soft drink cans cool. Features For the price point, the Tiago offers all the basic features you’d expect: keyless entry, push-button start stop, automatic climate control and cruise control are offered. The highlight is the new free-floating 10.25-inch touchscreen which we’ve seen in the Nexon and Punch as well. It is smooth, lag free and also supports wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Tata Motors has downgraded the audio system on the Tiago from a lovely 8-speaker setup to a basic 4-speaker sound system. Audio output is strictly average. The reverse camera has appreciable clarity, even in the dark. It also gets dynamic guidelines. It has a basic digital instrument cluster with a 4-inch black and white MID. Displays basic warnings including door status, tyre pressure monitoring and distance to empty. Other features include automatic headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, and auto-fold outside mirrors.

Safety
------
The Tiago scored a 4-star rating in the GlobalNCAP crash test conducted back in 2020. Child occupant safety was rated at 3 stars. Safety features include dual airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, electronic stability program and hill hold control.

Boot Space
----------
The Tiago has a rated boot space capacity of 242-litres. You can realistically fit in a couple of cabin-sized trolley bags and a backpack. Using a medium-size or large suitcase will take up almost the entirety of the boot. The boot space of the Tiago CNG is substantially lower at 107-litres. It still manages to pack in a few backpacks/duffle bags with ease.

Performance
-----------
The Tata Tiago 2025 is offered with a single 1.2-litre, three-cylinder engine. You can opt for a petrol + CNG version as well. Engine 1.2-litre petrol 1.2-litre petrol + CNG Output 86PS/113Nm 75.5PS/96.5Nm Gearbox 5-speed Manual/5-speed AMT The 3-cylinder petrol engine has a clattery sound. You can also feel some vibrations on the floorboard and pedals. I found the clutch to be light and the gear throws to be smooth enough. It is not particularly enthusiastic in nature, and rather picks up speed in a linear manner, making it best suited to a relaxed driving style. For city driving, the drivability is a highlight. You can be in second or third gear for most of the time. If I required a quick burst of acceleration, it was almost inevitable to downshift a gear or two. In-gear acceleration is not strong. Highway performance is reasonable — you can cruise between 70-100kmph. Do not expect strong acceleration for quick overtakes. They will most definitely require planning. The 5-speed AMT (automated manual transmission) offers convenience. But, gearshifts are noticeable and jerky, especially when the accelerator is pressed fully. Tiago CNG The Tiago CNG can start up on CNG directly — no need to start up on petrol and then switch. While the power and torque numbers are lower compared to the petrol mode, the drive experience isn’t all that different. For city commutes, you might not even be able to tell the difference between the two modes. From a running cost perspective, the Tiago CNG is ~ Rs3/km cheaper than the petrol. Consider the CNG version if you foresee heavy city use. In case of highway driving, especially with full passenger load and on hilly areas, the Tiago CNG will feel underpowered. It’s best to switch to petrol mode here.

Ride and Handling
-----------------
It absorbs potholes and rough surfaces well and keeps the cabin away from the harshness of the surface. Inside the city, the broken roads and speed breakers are dealt with ease. Highway stability is acceptable. It remains composed at triple digit speeds and lane changes can be done confidently too. In case of the Tiago CNG. to accommodate the 100 extra kilos in the boot, the rear suspension has been stiffened a bit and it can be felt on the sharper potholes, but the ride mostly remains stable and comfortable. As for handling, the Tiago remains as neutral as before. It feels safe when pushed into corners and body roll is kept under check as well.

Variants
--------
The Tata Tiago 2025 is available in four variants: XE, XM, XT, XZ and XZ+ Tata Tiago XE variant This base variant contains safety features such as dual airbags, ABS and rear parking sensors. It gets manual air-conditioning, front power windows, a digital instrument cluster and fabric upholstery. The tyre size here is smaller, at 13-inches. Tata Tiago XM variant: This variant adds a basic 3.5-inch music system and two speakers. Other feature additions include rear power windows, central locking and a day/night IRVM. Tata offers larger 14-inch wheels from this model onwards. Tata Tiago XT variant: A major highlight is the 7-inch touchscreen with wired Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. A four-speaker music system is also available. The safety package is better with a reverse camera, electronic stability control, hill hold control and a rear defogger. Tata Tiago XZ variant: Looks are enhanced by LED headlamps and LED daytime running lamps. The infotainment experience gets better with a 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and a digital instrument cluster. Other feature additions include an HD reverse camera, automatic climate control, automatic headlamps and wipers and auto-fold outside mirrors. Tata Tiago XZ+ variant: Tata Tiago top model gets 15-inch dual-tone alloy wheels, front fog lamps and a rear wiper for a complete look. Notable additions include cruise control and a tyre pressure monitoring system CarDekho Recommends: We would recommend you consider at least the XT variant of the Tiago car. It has a few modern day essentials and the safety package is better than lower models. For those wanting a better experience, XZ or XZ+ variants can be considered depending on the budget.

Verdict
-------
How we wish Tata would’ve given the Tiago a comprehensive generation change and not a mere facelift. Feature deletions (especially the 8-speaker audio system) could have been avoided too. That said, even in 2025, the Tata TIago is a hatchback you can consider. Whether it's your first ever car or the smaller second car in the family, the Tiago continues to deliver on its strengths of space and comfort. The new touchscreen and the availability of CNG across multiple variants sweetens the deal further.

Pros
----

- It has a 4-star Global NCAP safety rating
- A CNG kit is now available across all variants and gets an AMT option
